# QR-Code-Generator
 Create QR Code from string

Either run the script version, or the exe version in the dist/ directory to run the program. Then, take whatever string you want to convert to a QR code version of the string into the dialog box. Click save, type in the filename you'd like, click save and done! It can take a little bit before the file is created, but the program will save a QR code in a png format.
